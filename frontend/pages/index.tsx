        <p className="font-medium py-10 px-20">This is a web application that can help users enhance productivity by streamlining their notetaking using OpenAIâ€™s APIs. Our goal is to provide smarter tools for people to store, organize, and summarize their notes more intelligently, which will allow users to engage in their meetings, lectures, videos, etc. without having to take notes at the same time. This will help users better-absorb content without having to worry about taking notes at the same time. The application will provide personalized accounts for users to manage their stored notes.</p>
